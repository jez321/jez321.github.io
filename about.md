Hi, I'm Jeremy, a web developer (and sometimes UI/UX designer) living in Japan and currently working at [SocialDog](https://socialdog.jp).  

Before AutoScale I worked as a developer at NEC Solution Innovators, and before that as an English teacher(!) at Nova. 
A few more details about past work and projects can be found on my [homepage](https://jjohns.com).

I have worked in Angular/Typescript but mainly work in React/Typescript and Go now, primary developing the [SocialDog](https://social-dog.net/en) Twitter account management/automation app.
